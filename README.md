# Black Market

This monorepo contains a demo application showcasing Futureverse SDKs and tools for asset management and trading. The main application is a React Vite-based "Black Market" that demonstrates asset registration, viewing, and trading capabilities.

## Project Structure

- **`apps/black-market/`** - Main React Vite application
- **`libs/ui-shared/`** - Shared UI components library
- **`tools/`** - Development and utility scripts

## Features

The Black Market application demonstrates:

- **Asset Management**: View and manage digital assets using Futureverse Asset Register
- **Authentication**: Integration with Futureverse Auth for user authentication
- **Asset Trading**: Interactive asset viewing and trading interface
- **Game Integration**: Connect with game servers for asset synchronization
- **Transaction Management**: Real-time transaction details and gas estimation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd black-market
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `apps/black-market/` directory with the following variables:

```env
# Required for asset management
VITE_COLLECTION_CHARACTER_ID=your_character_collection_id
VITE_COLLECTION_EQUIPMENT_ID=your_equipment_collection_id
VITE_COLLECTION_STONE_ID=your_stone_collection_id

# Required for authentication and encryption
VITE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
VITE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
VITE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id

# Required for game integration
VITE_GAME_SERVER_URL=your_game_server_url

# Optional - defaults to 'development'
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

**Important Notes:**

- All environment variables starting with `VITE_` are required for the application to function properly
- If any required environment variable is missing, the application will show errors during build
- Make sure to add these environment variables to your Vercel deployment settings
- The `VITE_PRIVATE_KEY` should be a valid PEM-formatted private key
- The `VITE_PUBLIC_KEY` should be a valid PEM-formatted public key

### Development

**Build for production:**

```bash
npm run build
# or
npx nx build black-market
```

**Preview production build:**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

#### ✅ "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'startsWith')" Error - RESOLVED

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED** - This error has been resolved in the latest version.

**What was fixed:**

- Added proper null checks for all environment variables
- Implemented safe handling of `VITE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `VITE_PUBLIC_KEY`, and other environment variables
- Added conditional rendering and error handling for missing environment variables

**If you still encounter this error:**

1. **Check Environment Variables:**

   - Ensure all required environment variables are set in your `.env` file
   - Verify that all `VITE_` prefixed variables are properly configured
   - Check that the variables are not empty or undefined

2. **Required Environment Variables:**

   ```env
   VITE_COLLECTION_CHARACTER_ID=your_character_collection_id
   VITE_COLLECTION_EQUIPMENT_ID=your_equipment_collection_id
   VITE_COLLECTION_STONE_ID=your_stone_collection_id
   VITE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
   VITE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
   VITE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   VITE_GAME_SERVER_URL=your_game_server_url
   VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development
   ```

3. **For Vercel Deployment:**
   - **QUAN TRỌNG:** Environment variables phải được cấu hình trong Vercel dashboard
   - Vào [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard) → Project Settings → Environment Variables
   - Thêm tất cả biến môi trường với prefix `VITE_`
   - Chọn environment: Production, Preview, Development
   - Redeploy sau khi thêm environment variables

#### 🔴 "No Output Directory named 'black-market' found" Error

**Nguyên nhân:** Vercel không tìm thấy output directory đúng cho Nx monorepo.

**Giải pháp:**

1. **Cấu hình Vercel Dashboard:**

   - Vào Project Settings trong Vercel
   - Trong section "Build & Development Settings"
   - Đặt **Output Directory** thành: `dist/apps/black-market`
   - Đặt **Build Command** thành: `npx nx build black-market`
   - Đặt **Install Command** thành: `npm install`

2. **Hoặc sử dụng vercel.json:**

   - File `vercel.json` đã được cấu hình đúng
   - Đảm bảo Vercel đọc file này từ root directory

3. **Kiểm tra cấu hình:**
   ```json
   {
     "buildCommand": "npx nx build black-market",
     "outputDirectory": "dist/apps/black-market",
     "installCommand": "npm install",
     "framework": "vite"
   }
   ```

#### Node Version Issues

1. **Node Version:**

   - Ensure you're using Node.js v18 or higher
   - Check with: `node --version`

2. **Dependencies:**

   - Clear node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

3. **Environment Variables:**

   - Ensure all required environment variables are set in Vercel
   - Check that variable names start with `VITE_`

4. **Build Failures:**
   - Check Vercel build logs for specific error messages
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed

### Performance Optimization

1. **Bundle Size:**

   - The build process automatically optimizes bundle size
   - Check build output in Vercel dashboard

2. **Caching:**
   - Vercel automatically handles caching for static assets
   - Configure cache headers if needed
