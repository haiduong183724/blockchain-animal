# Black Market

This monorepo contains a demo application showcasing Futureverse SDKs and tools for asset management and trading. The main application is a React Vite-based "Black Market" that demonstrates asset registration, viewing, and trading capabilities.

## Project Structure

- **`apps/black-market/`** - Main React Vite application
- **`libs/ui-shared/`** - Shared UI components library
- **`tools/`** - Development and utility scripts

## Features

The Black Market application demonstrates:

- **Asset Management**: View and manage digital assets using Futureverse Asset Register
- **Authentication**: Integration with Futureverse Auth for user authentication
- **Asset Trading**: Interactive asset viewing and trading interface
- **Game Integration**: Connect with game servers for asset synchronization
- **Transaction Management**: Real-time transaction details and gas estimation

## Getting  Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd black-market
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the `apps/black-market/` directory with the following variables:

```env
# Required for asset management
VITE_COLLECTION_CHARACTER_ID=your_character_collection_id
VITE_COLLECTION_EQUIPMENT_ID=your_equipment_collection_id
VITE_COLLECTION_STONE_ID=your_stone_collection_id

# Required for authentication and encryption
VITE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
VITE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
VITE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id

# Required for game integration
VITE_GAME_SERVER_URL=your_game_server_url

# Optional - defaults to 'development'
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

**Important Notes:**

- All environment variables starting with `VITE_` are required for the application to function properly
- If any required environment variable is missing, the application will show errors during build
- Make sure to add these environment variables to your Vercel deployment settings
- The `VITE_PRIVATE_KEY` should be a valid PEM-formatted private key
- The `VITE_PUBLIC_KEY` should be a valid PEM-formatted public key

### Development

**Start the development server:**

```bash
npm run start
# or
npx nx serve black-market

**Build for production:**

```bash
npm run build
# or
npx nx build black-market
```

**Preview production build:**

```bash
npm run preview
# or
